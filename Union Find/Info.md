QF: the basic implementation of the Quick Find Algorithm. This is a very slow approach and impractical.

UF: The improved Union-Find Algorithm. This is an extremely efficient approach and is improved by adding small variations such as the weighted Union-Find with Path Compression.

Percolation: This is an implementation of the Percolation problem, which is used for network connectictivity, dynamic connectivity, games, etc.

PercolationStats: This utilizes the Percolation class to create a Monte-Carlo Simulation which is used to Find the Percolation threshold and other such useful data
